### Fun way the share your love for legos with your love for coding
This poject is a great way to spend some time with your kids while introducing to the world of coding and electronics.
In this project we will build a remotely controlled Car that your kids can decorate with legos. 

This project will require some parts as follows:
###### **Raspberry pi:** `A model 3b+ or 4 - You need to be able to have a wireless lan connection.`
###### **4WD Robot car kit:** `The one used in our project was Joy-it 4WD Kit, but there are lots of alternatives around.`
###### **A breadboard**
###### **4 5V DC Motors:** `These will be included in the kit, but you could buy them separately if you don't want to buy a ready kit.`
###### **2 * l293D Motor controller:** `For controlling the motors. One controller can be used to control two DC motors or one stepper motor.`
###### **USB Powerbank** `For powering the raspberry pi.`
###### **Battery enclosure:** `You need a battery enclosure for batteries. You can use 4 AA batteries or a single 9V battery.`
###### **Legos:** `These are for the design. Our kids went with a cute little appartment on top of our robot, but I can only imagine how many different designs you could come up with. Let your imagination go wild.`
